Research Objectives 

The principal objective of this work is to propose the automation of the network in order to design the network to be friendlier to demonstrate efficiency scripting in network hardware configuration.

1.	Investigate an appropriate topology configuration for network automation 
2.	Develop a network interface by libraries scripting to increase the efficiency of network (speed, response time.)
